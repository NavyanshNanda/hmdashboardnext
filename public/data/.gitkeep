# CSV Data Files

## Required File

Place your CSV file in this directory with the exact name:
`TA Tracker - HM Sheet.csv`

## CSV Format Requirements

The CSV should have the following columns (matching the original Streamlit dashboard):
- Sourcing Date
- HM Details
- Skill
- Location of posting
- Recruiter Name
- Candidate Name
- Status
- Status of R1
- Status of R2
- Status of R3
- Screening check status
- TTF (60 days)
- TTH (30 days)

## Note

- The first row should be metadata (it will be skipped during processing)
- The second row should contain the column headers
- This directory is served statically by Next.js

## Testing

Once you add the CSV file, refresh the dashboard at http://localhost:3000 to see the data loaded and processed.
